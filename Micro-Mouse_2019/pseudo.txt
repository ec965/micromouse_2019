structs
	cell - 4 walls, distance
	coord - cordinates

functions
	distance - how far a cell is from another cell

	distance to goal - how far is the current cell from the end cell
	//distance is the number on the cells added up
	 - at goal? - check if we are at the goal; distance == 0

	update distances -
		1. if all cells around current cell are larger than current cell
		2. add current cell to stack
		3. current cell should be open neighbor +1
		4. if it is not then set current cell to that value
		5. push all neighbors onto the stack and check them

	check bound - is the cell we are looking at part within the boundaries?

flood fill - 

void loop
	check walls
	choose direction
	if direction is a cardinal direction
		move
	if direction is zero
		flood fill - update distances
